## Project Introduction
Meditation Application is a solo-developed project by Jeevan Adhikari. The following program is just a very very simple half-complete demo of the application which only contains a timer.
## Program Execution
Run the following code in your desired folder using cmd
```
git clone https://github.com/boyScavedo/Meditation-Application.git
```
This will create the files I have in this repo. Then 'cd' into the "Meditation-Application" folder and run the following 
```
code main.py
```
voila, you have the code, which you can edit or execute.
